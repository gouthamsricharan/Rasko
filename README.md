A new Flutter project that is used for writing simple notes

## 🚀 About This Project

This is a simple Note Application built using Flutter. The main purpose of this app is to allow users to write and store notes securely. One of the key features of this application is that it allows users to back up their notes and restore them on any device just by logging into their account. This makes accessing notes easy and seamless across multiple devices.

This project was created as part of my learning journey with Dart and Flutter. It helped me understand the core concepts of app development, especially in handling state and separating UI from business logic.

The app uses BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture for state management. This helps to cleanly separate the user interface from the underlying logic, making the code more organized, scalable, and easier to maintain.
